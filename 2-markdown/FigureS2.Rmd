\subsection{Extended data item 3. Effect of PCA transformation (feature extraction) on the performance of cancer predition models.} 
\textbf{(a)} "multi-3C-autogluon" is a version of the classifier trained on 17,837 selected features from the original feature space (beta-methylation values of CpGs).
\textbf{(b)} "multi-3C-autogluon\_PC" is a version of the classifier trained on 1646 principal components derived from the beta-methylation values, as well as (chronological) age of a sample's subject and predicted immune cell composition of a sample.
Multi-class classifiers were trained on the "3CDisc" with the automated machine learning framework AutoGluon and accuracy was evaluated on the "3CExtVal" data sets comparing each class versus the rest of the classes. Top panels give the distribution of the predicted probabilities for controls (cancer free women), breast, ovarian or endometrial cancer cases. Bottom panels give the corresponding receiver operator curves (ROCs).
